# PySolitaire 🂡

A terminal-based ASCII Klondike Solitaire game in Python

PySolitaire is a **single-player Klondike Solitaire** game played entirely in your terminal.
It uses **cursor-based navigation** with **Enter to pick up / drop cards**, aiming to feel natural, responsive, and faithful to classic Solitaire—without becoming a heavy GUI application.

The game is designed to be **playable, deterministic, and test-driven**, while remaining simple and fun.

## How to Play (Quick Start)

### The Core Interaction Model

PySolitaire uses a **cursor-driven pick/drop model**:

1. Use **arrow keys** to move the cursor to a card or pile.
2. Press **Enter** to **pick up**:

   * A face-up card (or run) from a tableau pile
   * The top card from the waste
   * (Optionally) the top card from a foundation
3. Move the cursor to a destination pile.
4. Press **Enter** again to **drop**:

   * If the move is legal → it succeeds
   * If illegal → the selection remains and an error message is shown
5. Press **Enter** again on the original source (or **Esc**) to cancel.

If there is **only one legal destination**, the game may automatically move the card for you.

---

## Board Layout

* **Stock**: Draw pile (top left)
* **Waste**: Face-up drawn cards
* **Foundations (4)**: Build Ace → King by suit
* **Tableau (7)**: Build descending, alternating colors

The cursor moves between these zones predictably using the arrow keys.

---

## Draw Modes

### Draw-1 (default)

* Draw one card at a time from stock to waste
* Easier gameplay
* Enables loss detection after full passes with no legal moves

### Draw-3 (optional)

Enable via command-line flag:

```bash
pysolitaire --draw3
```

Draw-3 rules follow classic Klondike behavior, including stock recycling.

---

## Saving & Resuming

* The game **auto-saves on quit**
* On startup, you’ll be prompted to:

  * Resume the previous game
  * Start a new one
* Save file location:

  ```
  ~/.config/pysolitaire/save.json
  ```
* Saves include:

  * Full game state
  * Timer
  * Move count

Winning a game automatically clears the save.

---

## Undo System

* Press **U** to undo the last move
* Up to **100 moves** are stored
* Undo restores:

  * Card positions
  * Face-up / face-down state
  * Timer and move count

---

## Leaderboards

* Separate leaderboards for **Draw-1** and **Draw-3**
* Top **20 scores** per mode
* Sorted by:

  1. Fewest moves
  2. Fastest time
* Stored at:

  ```
  ~/.config/pysolitaire/leaderboard.json
  ```

After winning, you’ll be prompted for **3-letter initials** (arcade-style).

---

## Configuration & Reproducibility

### Seeded games

For reproducible deals:

```bash
pysolitaire --seed 12345
```

This is useful for:

* Testing
* Debugging
* Sharing specific deals

---

## Development Notes

* Core logic is **fully test-driven**
* Game rules are implemented as **pure functions**
* UI code is isolated from rules and state
* Deterministic shuffling via seedable RNG
* Designed for Linux / macOS / WSL terminals

---

## Troubleshooting

### Terminal too small

If your terminal is smaller than **100×40**, the game will exit with an explanatory error.
Resize your terminal window and try again.
